Both of these files were created by following an instructables guide. Should this code work it can be easily modified for multiple load cell systems.
Currently this code will only function by utilizing one load cell. Additionally the instructables code utilized a library found on github in order to have the system
operate like an actual scale. Both links utilized in the creation of this code are found in both files as well as given below.
